# DroneRacer

A thrilling 3D third-person drone racing game where players navigate through challenging obstacle courses at high speeds.

## Game Concept

DroneRacer puts you in control of a high-speed racing drone, navigating through intricate courses filled with obstacles, tight turns, and precision challenges. Race against the clock, beat your personal best, or compete against AI drones in this fast-paced aerial racing experience.

## Gameplay Features

### Drone Control
- Control the drone using keyboard inputs (WASD for movement)
- Space bar for boost acceleration
- Shift key for quick rolls and sharp turns
- Third-person camera that follows the drone, maintaining visibility

### Obstacle Course
- Various obstacles including walls, gates, and floating barriers
- Progressive difficulty as the player advances
- Dynamic course layouts for replayability

### Power-Ups
- Speed boosts for temporary acceleration
- Shield barriers for protection against collisions
- Slow-motion abilities to navigate difficult sections

### Checkpoints & Progression
- Strategic checkpoint placement throughout the course
- Must pass through all checkpoints to complete the course
- Restart from the last passed checkpoint if missed

### Timing System
- Countdown timer for each race
- Total race time tracking
- Complete courses as quickly as possible for high scores

### Dynamic Environment
- Moving obstacles that require timing and precision
- Wind gusts affecting drone stability
- Varied terrain (tunnels, hills, narrow passages)

### Game Over Conditions
- Crashing into obstacles ends the current run
- Missing checkpoints requires backtracking
- Restart prompts after course completion or failure

### Scoring System
- Time-based scoring (faster completion = higher score)
- Bonus points for power-up collection
- Performance rating based on precision and speed

## Graphics

- Simple but fluid 3D visuals for drone, course, and obstacles
- Multiple environment themes:
  - Indoor factory setting
  - Outdoor park landscapes
  - Futuristic cityscape
- Customizable drone appearance with different skins and colors
- Visual effects for speed, impacts, and power-ups

## Controls and Mechanics

- **Third-Person Camera**: Positioned behind and slightly above the drone
- **User Interface**: Displays timer, score, and active power-ups
- **Drone Physics**: Realistic simulation of speed, turning, and momentum
- **Control Scheme**:
  - **W/Up Arrow**: Move forward
  - **S/Down Arrow**: Move backward
  - **A/Left Arrow**: Turn left
  - **D/Right Arrow**: Turn right
  - **Space**: Boost/Ascend
  - **Shift**: Quick roll/Descend
  - **R**: Reset position

## Technical Implementation

- Built with React and Three.js for 3D rendering
- Physics-based drone movement and collision detection
- Responsive design that works across different devices
- Performance optimized for smooth gameplay
- Target platform: Web-based using p5.js for 3D visuals and mechanics
